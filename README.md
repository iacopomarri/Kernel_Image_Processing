# Kernel_Image_Processing
Laboratorio universit√†

This software allows you to upload and modify your images in netpbm format (.ppm, .pgm, .pbm) by applying some base effects
like blur, sharpen or edge detection. Once you've modified your file you can save it on your pc by typing the desired path and 
name for the new image.
